## Introduction

Cryptocurrency trading can be complex and time-consuming, requiring both knowledge and constant market monitoring. For those without the time or expertise to trade actively, **Binance Copy Trading** is a solution. In this guide, we’ll explain what Binance Copy Trading is, how it works, and provide a step-by-step tutorial to get you started.

## What Is Binance Copy Trading?

**Binance Copy Trading** lets users automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders. This feature simplifies market participation, allowing beginners to follow **Lead Traders** without manually executing trades. 

As of May 2024, Binance Copy Trading is available in selected locations for both **Spot** and **Futures** markets, offering a valuable tool for novice traders or users seeking a hands-off trading experience.

## How Binance Copy Trading Works

### 1. Selecting a Trader

The first step is choosing a **Lead Trader** to copy. Binance provides a list of available traders with detailed profiles showcasing their trading performance, strategies, risk levels, and historical data. This transparency helps users make informed decisions when selecting who to follow.

### 2. Automatic Execution

Once a **Lead Trader** is chosen, all their future trades are automatically replicated in your account. These include opening and closing positions, as well as adjusting stop-loss and take-profit levels. The automation enables users to benefit from the trader’s expertise without manual intervention.

### 3. Control and Flexibility

Though automated, Binance Copy Trading gives users control over their accounts. You can adjust settings like the amount of capital to allocate and stop copying a trader at any time, allowing for risk management and flexibility.

## Risk Management

Binance provides tools to help users manage risks, including setting **maximum loss limits** and controlling the portion of your total capital dedicated to copy trading. 

> **Note**: Trading always involves risk, and you may experience losses if the strategy you're following is unsuccessful. Be sure to only invest what you can afford to lose.

## Benefits of Binance Copy Trading

### 1. Access to Experienced Traders

By copying seasoned traders, users gain access to professional knowledge and strategies, which can improve their understanding of trading over time.

### 2. Time-Saving

Copy trading eliminates the need for constant market monitoring and manual trade execution, saving time for users who may have other commitments.

### 3. Diversification

Users can diversify their investments by following multiple traders with different strategies and risk profiles, which can help spread risk and enhance long-term returns.

- **Fixed Ratio**: Invest in proportion to the Lead Trader’s position size.

Under **Advanced Settings**, you can adjust margin mode, leverage, and other parameters.
